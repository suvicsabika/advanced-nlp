# Advanced Natural Language Processing project

##  PERSONALIZED AND STYLIZED HEADLINE GENERATION WITH LLM COLLABORATION
### Project Description:
 * The goal of this project is to develop a natural language processing system capable of
generating personalized, attention-grabbing headlines based on the content of news articles.
Unlike traditional summarization tools, this system not only condenses the article into a short
title but also adapts the output to the userâ€™s interests and stylistic preferences (e.g., formal,
casual, sensational, question-based).
 * The solution is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are fine-tuned or adapted
through techniques such as prompt engineering, LoRA, and reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF). The system learns to identify key information in a news article,
match it with the user profile, and generate a headline that is both contextually accurate and
stylistically appropriate.
 * The user interacts with the system by specifying their topic interests and preferred headline
tone. The system then retrieves or receives a news article, processes it through tokenization
and embedding, and uses a transformer-based LLM to generate a customized headline. The
output is evaluated and refined based on user feedback.
